# Project Overview

kCoin is being developed by [Kowala](https://www.kowala.tech), a multinational
team of thinkers, technologists and enthusiasts. The first kCoin to be released
will be kUSD, a cryptocurrency that autonomously keeps value with the US
Dollar, and we intend to release several other currencies shortly afterward.

Thought almost all of our code is [open source](https://github.com/kowala-tech),
the main main kCoin repository is currently closed source. We realise that in order
for a cryptocurrency to be publicly verifiable and maximally secure it must be open
source, we as fully intent to make it so later on.

kUSD is currently in an **alpha** state
and its available via [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/kowalatech/kusd/).
If you want to play with the system in current (and possible unstable) form, then you
can use the [testnet](/getting-started/testnet).

# Overview

This section contains tips to help you get going quickly.

Kowala uses a set new protocols and technologies such as 'Proof-of-Stake' or
'Trusted Execution Environments'. With new technologies comes a set of new
terms, definitions and thoughts. We've included a
[glossary](http://docs.kowala.tech/glossary/) that covers relevant terms.

At its core, Kowala includes a currency that targets a value of 1 USD dollar
called kUSD, and a mining token, mUSD, that is used to secure rewards in kUSD -
we've tokenized the rights to participate in the consensus. To learn more about
Kowala's consensus protocol, please visit the [proof-of-stake
section](http://docs.kowala.tech/consensus/proof-of-stake/).

Kowala and all the other stable coins require access to data about the current
currency value from exchanges. Oracles aim to meet this need and we've
[explained our process](http://docs.kowala.tech/oracle/) in detail.

The following sections of this module include instructions on how to use
Kowala's features:

- We start by detailing the process to [join the latest test
  network](/getting-started/testnet/).
- [Validator Registry](/getting-started/testnet/) lays out the process of
  registering a client as a consensus validator.

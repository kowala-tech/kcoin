# Welcome

This portal contains the official technical documentation for the kCoin
project, including kUSD. kCoins are a family of stable-value cryptocurrencies
that keep parity with fiat currencies using a system called the Kowala
Protocol. More information and our technical white paper can be found on
Kowala's website, [kowala.tech](https://www.kowala.tech).

The flagship kCoin is _kUSD_ which, as its name suggests, is designed to keep
parity with the US Dollar. This documentation assuming you're using kUSD, and
will be updated as the project progresses. kUSD is currently in an **alpha**
state and not all of its documented features are implemented in their final form.

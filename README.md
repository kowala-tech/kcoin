## kCoin

Official implementation of the Kowala protocol based on the [go-ethereum client](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/). This monorepo contains the mining client and all its associated tools and public services. The **`kcoin`** mining client is the main access point to all kcoin networks, including kUSD, and we're working on other cool stuff too. To learn more about the project please visit the [Kowala website](https://kowala.tech) or read the [official technical documentation](http://docs.kowala.tech/).

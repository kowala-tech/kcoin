/*
Package bmt provides a binary merkle tree implementation

Binary Merkle Tree Hash is a hash function over arbitrary datachunks of limited size
It is defined as the root hash of the binary merkle tree built over fixed size segments
of the underlying chunk using any base hash function (e.g keccak 256 SHA3)

It is used as the chunk hash function in swarm which in turn is the basis for the
128 branching swarm hash http://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html#swarm-hash

The BMT is optimal for providing compact inclusion proofs, i.e. prove that a
segment is a substring of a chunk starting at a particular offset
The size of the underlying segments is fixed at 32 bytes (called the resolution
of the BMT hash), the EVM word size to optimize for on-chain BMT verification
as well as the hash size optimal for inclusion proofs in the merkle tree of the swarm hash.

Two implementations are provided:

* RefHasher is optimized for code simplicity and meant as a reference implementation
* Hasher is optimized for speed taking advantage of concurrency with minimalistic
  control structure to coordinate the concurrent routines
  It implements the ChunkHash interface as well as the go standard hash.Hash interface
